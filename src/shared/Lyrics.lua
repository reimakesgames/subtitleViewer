-- Leave me the hell alone
-- You know I'm not the only one
-- Just find someone else to talk about
-- I've got no time to fuck around
-- If this is what you want from me to get attention
-- You're parasocial

-- We've never met before and I don't even know about ya
-- You better let me go 'cause I don't wanna know about ya
-- I've got my friends and you don't get to be my friend
-- So stop making me sick, you're freaking me out
-- I'm giving up, now I'm paranoid
-- You're parasocial
-- You're parasocial

-- I've heard that I was someone's best friend
-- All the sudden, I became a person who been saying shit
-- Out of nowhere, I just got another hater when I'm not even that famous
-- What a stupid situation I'm dealing with

-- I think it's fine 'cause I've been hiding that I'm burning out
-- And after all, they wouldn't know what I just sang about
-- But once again, If you're talking shit on Twitter
-- Should cut your own fingers, that will make your life better

-- Leave me the hell alone
-- You know I'm not the only one
-- Just find someone else to talk about
-- I've got no time to fuck around
-- If this is what you want from me to get attention
-- You're parasocial

-- We've never met before and I don't even know about ya
-- You better let me go 'cause I don't wanna know about ya
-- I've got my friends and you don't get to be my friend
-- So stop making me sick, you're freaking me out
-- I'm giving up, now I'm paranoid
-- You're parasocial
-- You're parasocial

-- You're parasocial
-- You're parasocial

-- Leave me the hell alone
-- You know I'm not the only one
-- Just find someone else to talk about
-- I've got no time to fuck around
-- If this is what you want from me to get attention
-- You're parasocial

-- We've never met before and I don't even know about ya
-- You better let me go 'cause I don't wanna know about ya
-- I've got my friends and you don't get to be my friend
-- So stop making me sick, you're freaking me out
-- I'm giving up, now I'm paranoid
-- You're parasocial
-- You're parasocial

-- You're parasocial
